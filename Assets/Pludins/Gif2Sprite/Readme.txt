Hello,

Gif2Sprite is a Unity plugin which allows you to import Gif as a sprite.

After import Gif2Sprite to your project, to run the demo, you need to do:
1. In \Gif2Sprite\Demo folder of your project, file Ken's_Hurricane_Kick.png and Ken's_Hurricane_Kick.anim should be generated automatically from Ken's_Hurricane_Kick.gifsprite already. If they are not, please right click on Ken's_Hurricane_Kick.gifsprite and select "Reimport".
2. Double click the Demo.unity
3. Drag the Ken's_Hurricane_Kick.png to your scene. Set the object's position to (0, 0, 0).
4. Click the Ken's_Hurricane_Kick.anim, check the "Loop Time" in Inspector panel.
5. Drag and drop the Ken's_Hurricane_Kick.anim to the object we just created in scene.
6. Now, the object in scene should have 3 components: Transform, Sprite Renderer and Animator. So, that's it. Click Play button and enjoy!
